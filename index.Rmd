## About

Dan Carpenter is an ecologist and environmental data scientist. I am interested in using environmental data to support evidence-based decision making. I think good data are the foundations of good decisions and much of my work is about turning good data into evidence to support those decisions.

I have a BSc (Hons.) in Wildlife Conservation (University of East London) and a PhD in Soil Science (University of Reading). I have worked in academic research, local government, NGOs and the private sector. I am a Chartered Environmentalist (CEnv). For more on my background, please see my CV.

I currently work for Ethos Environmental Planning Ltd where I put into practice the business of using data for decision making.

I drink a LOT of tea. I love cricket.
