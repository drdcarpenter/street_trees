77 cars, 13 spaces, total ~ 90 spaces, north
67 cars, 15 spaces, total ~83 spaces, south

space size

north = 6 metres per space
south = 5.4 metres per space

According to BFC parking standard (https://www.bracknell-forest.gov.uk/sites/default/files/documents/parking-standards-supplementary-planning-document-2016.pdf) a parking space shouild be 4.8 metres long and 2.4 metres wide.

If we are generous and allow 5 metres per parking space, then Liverpool Road has capacity for:

north = 109 spaces
south = 90 spaces

All measurements are approximate.

The lack of marked bays is potentially reducing capacity by up to 26 spaces.

Tree pits are approx 1.2 m x 1.2 m (https://stockholmtreepits.co.uk/).  Allow a total of 2m x 2m for a new tree in the carriageway. Obviously proper tree advice is required!

14 metre centres north = 32 trees = 64 metres = 13 parking spaces
14 metre centres south = 28 trees = 36 metres = 7 parking spaces

total = 60 trees = 100 metres = 20 parking spaces

So, in theory, marking out parking bays and introducing 60 trees could result in a net gain of 6 parking spaces.
